# Art Connoisseur Bot

**Art Connoisseur Bot** is a smart Streamlit application that analyzes your uploaded artwork to uncover its artistic style, historical context, and visual influences. Powered by [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno), OpenAI's GPT-4o, and SerpAPI, the bot generates a beautifully structured art brief with style analysis, interpretation, and curated references.
